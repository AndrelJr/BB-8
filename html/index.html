    <h1>Hello, Eric </h1>
    <p>I like robots, and right now I am working on a life-sized BB-8. I want the BB-8 to be controlled from a website but first the bottom robot has to be put together</p>
    <p>BB-8 is a robot from the seventh Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens. He is a small ball robot with a balancing head. He is really cute and everyone likes him. I really want my BB-8 to roll this year.</p>
